# Titanic-Survivor-Analysis
conducted a Titanic survivor analysis using AI and ML to predict passenger survival based on various features. The project involved data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training using packages like Pandas for data manipulation, Scikit-learn for model building, and Matplotlib for data visualization. Key steps included handling missing values, normalizing data, and using classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machines. The project demonstrated the application of machine learning techniques to historical data, providing insights into survival factors and enhancing predictive modeling skills.
